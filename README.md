# bitrate-eval
Loops through your iTunes library and evaluates bitrates

Default Outputs
- Notes file formats that aren't mp3
- Notes files that are less than 320kbps

Currently this project only barely works. 
- There are issues with the library implemented to evaluate bitrates (ie. not all mp3's @ 320kbps will be evaluated as such)
- For some reason the virtual environment won't always be setup properly
